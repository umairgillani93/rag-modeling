1. ChatGpt assumes table names by default
2. We wrote a function 'tables_list' to let ChatGpt know what are the tables that exist inside our schema 
3. We than created a separated tool to access let ChatGpt access our required tables
4. We than went ahead and create custom classes for ChatGpt tools to access the relevant argument and have complete
information of functions arguments that we are passing to ChatGpt.
