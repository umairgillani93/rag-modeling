LangSmith can help with testing LLM applications in several ways:

1. **Beta Testing**: LangSmith allows developers to collect more data on how their LLM applications are performing in real-world scenarios. In this phase, it's important to develop an understanding for the types of inputs the app is performing well or poorly on and how exactly it's breaking down in those cases. Both feedback collection and run annotation are critical for this workflow.
2. **Capturing Feedback**: When launching your application to an initial set of users, it's important to gather human feedback on the responses it's producing. This helps draw attention to the most interesting runs and highlight edge cases that are causing problematic responses. LangSmith allows you to attach feedback scores to logged traces (oftentimes, this is hooked up to a feedback button in your app), then filter on traces that have a specific feedback tag and score.
3. **Annotating Traces**: LangSmith also supports sending runs to annotation queues, which allow annotators to closely inspect interesting traces and annotate them with respect to different criteria. Annotators can be PMs, engineers, or even subject matter experts. This allows users to catch regressions across important evaluation criteria.
4. **Adding Runs to a Dataset**: As your application progresses through the beta testing phase, it's essential to continue collecting data to refine and improve its performance. LangSmith enables you to add runs as examples to datasets (from both the project page and within an annotation queue), expanding your test coverage on real-world scenarios.
5. **Monitoring and A/B Testing**: LangSmith provides monitoring charts that allow you to track key metrics over time. You can expand to view metrics for a given period and drill down into a specific data point to get a trace table for that time period â€” this is especially handy for debugging production issues. LangSmith also allows for tag and metadata grouping, which allows users to mark different versions of their applications with different identifiers and view how they are performing side-by-side within each chart. This is helpful for A/B testing changes in prompt, model, or retrieval strategy.

Overall, LangSmith provides a comprehensive platform for LLM application development, monitoring, and testing, helping developers to quickly test out different prompts and models, capture feedback, annotate traces, and monitor performance.
